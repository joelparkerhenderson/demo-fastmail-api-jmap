#
# ## 2. Mailboxes
#
# A Mailbox represents a named set of Email objects.  This is the
# primary mechanism for organising messages within an account.  It is
# analogous to a folder or a label in other systems.  A Mailbox may
# perform a certain role in the system; see below for more details.
#
# For compatibility with IMAP, an Email MUST belong to one or more
# Mailboxes.  The Email id does not change if the Email changes
# Mailboxes.
#
# A *Mailbox* object has the following properties:
#
#   * id: "Id" (immutable; server-set).
#
#     The id of the Mailbox.
#
#   * name: "String"
#
#     User-visible name for the Mailbox, e.g., "Inbox".  This MUST be a
#     Net-Unicode string [RFC5198] of at least 1 character in length,
#     subject to the maximum size given in the capability object.  There
#     MUST NOT be two sibling Mailboxes with both the same parent and
#     the same name.  Servers MAY reject names that violate server
#     policy (e.g., names containing a slash (/) or control characters).
#
#  * etc.
#
#  The following JMAP methods are supported.
#
# ## 2.1.  Mailbox/get
#
# This is a standard "/get" method as described in [RFC8620],
# Section 5.1.  The "ids" argument may be "null" to fetch all at once.
